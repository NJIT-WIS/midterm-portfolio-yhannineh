                <p>I am currently a student at NJIT (New Jersey Institute of Technology), where I am passionately pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. My journey in the field of IT has been truly exhilarating, with a specific focus on web development. Throughout my academic tenure, I have delved deep into the intricacies of creating web applications and websites that not only exhibit seamless functionality but also prioritize the delivery of an exceptional user experience. This has not only fueled my love for the subject but has also given me a profound understanding of the significance of user-centric design and efficient web solutions.
                    In addition to my academic endeavors, I bring to the table valuable real-world experience. I have had the privilege of serving as an assistant manager at IHOP, where I had the opportunity to lead and inspire a team. This role has not only honed my leadership skills but has also been a source of invaluable lessons in problem-solving and unwavering dedication to providing top-notch customer service. I firmly believe that the combination of my academic knowledge and practical experiences has prepared me to excel in the dynamic and ever-evolving tech industry. I am eagerly counting down the days until my graduation in the spring of 2025, with my sights firmly set on transitioning into the role of a software engineer. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing my skills and insights to innovative software development projects, leaving a lasting and impactful mark on the technology landscape.</p>
